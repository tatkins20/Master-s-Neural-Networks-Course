## Contributing
Compile slides using pandoc and the provided script (handout includes notes and disables iterative lists):

Slides:  01-introduction tutorial
Handout version: 01-introduction handout
Both: 01-introduction
Make sure you have pandoc and texlive installed. Usually the following should suffice sudo apt install pandoc texlive-latex-base texlive-pictures texlive-latex-recommended. For Mac brew install pandoc and reopening terminal worked fine. You don't need to build the presentations if you want to contribute - editing the markdown is enough.
